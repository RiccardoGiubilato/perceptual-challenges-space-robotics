        This workshop brings together researchers working on the broad topic of perception for planetary exploration rovers. The workshop will serve as a platform for communication and exchange of ideas, fostering collaboration on a challenging field that often plays a niche role in major robotics conferences.
Future planetary exploration and exploitation envision robotic agents not merely as simple explorers, traversing terrains and sampling scientifically relevant information, but also as active partners in building the infrastructure needed to sustain human activities in space. These agents will need to sense and act, behaving as a natural extension of human astronauts, but also being able to build up infrastructure to enable long-term robotic operation, communication, and supporting human presence on planetary surfaces. 
Achieving these ambitious goals demands advanced environmental understanding. In absence of powerful and online means of global positioning, accurate localization with respect to local scenes becomes critical for interaction tasks such as grasping and manipulation of scientific or infrastructural elements. Place recognition for loop closure detection in SLAM is key towards long-term stability of localization estimates, while semantic mapping can provide astronauts and mission control with rich contextual information, as well as decisional inputs to estimate terrain traversability.
Beyond the limitations imposed by energy and computational budget, significant challenges emerge already from a methodological perspective. Before considering the case of an anthropized world, the severely unstructured nature of a planetary surface has severe implications in the context of its visual appearance: visual and structural aliasing, as well as lack of unambiguous features challenge robotic agents in the creation of consistent geometric representations. This is exacerbated by harsh lighting conditions, e.g. when operating on the lunar south pole, or in darkness. 
While traditional systems operate relying on visual perception for navigation, multi-modal solutions can be explored relying on solid-state technologies for LiDAR, or RADAR sensors. Furthermore, powerful Deep Learning models can help significantly with respect to all the challenges highlighted already, being capable of re-detect scenes under aliasing, as well as extracting rich semantic contexts for human interaction. 
Recent achievements in unmanned planetary exploration missions, e.g. NASA’s Curiosity and Ingenuity, as well as planned ones, such as CADRE (Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration) from JPL or the JAXA/DLR Mars Moon Exploration (MMX) rover, demonstrate not only the increasing interest in robotic missions but also an increasing complexity of behaviors and requirements. From complex autonomous flight and landing site detection, to mobility in micro-gravity and non-wheeled locomotion, e.g., JPL’s EELS, a need arises for novel methodologies to address the perceptual challenge hindering localization, navigation and in-situ operations. 
The workshop will serve as a platform for discussion and exchange between practitioners and leaders of robotic missions, and researchers working on methodological innovation, fostering the development of new solutions to fundamental questions
